# numerical

> Numerical computing, in Rust!

I started this project to learn more of the rust's ecosystem, such as testing, and documentation features.

## To do

- [ ] Function to create a matrix (to enforce the use of `nalgebra::DMatrix` with `f64` entries).
- [ ] Tests and docs for [linear regression](src/package/linear_regression.rs) functions.
