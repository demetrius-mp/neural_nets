# numerical

> Numerical computing, in Rust!

I started this project to learn more of the rust's ecosystem, such as testing, and documentation features.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add docs for [logistic regression](src/package/logistic_regression.rs) functions.
- [ ] Add docs for [linear regression](src/package/linear_regression.rs) functions.

## Considering

- Rename [`create_matrix.rs`](src/package/create_matrix.rs) to `matrix.rs`.
- Rename the project to `neural_nets` (since most of this code reproduces my study on neural networks during my Computer Science MSc).
